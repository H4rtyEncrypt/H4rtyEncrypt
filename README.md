Hello, Iâ€™m @H4rtyEncrypt.

I've had a strong interest in computers since I was 11, with a relentless curiosity to understand their inner workings. Now at 16, I've developed a robust skill set in various areas, including social engineering, security, and networking.

I began exploring social engineering at the age of 13 and have since generated a notable income at my age (in the range of xx,xxx.xx). My programming experience includes developing Python and HTML projects for clients via Telegram.

From 2021 to 2023, I successfully managed a Telegram group focused solely on social engineering, growing it to over 1,000 members.

I have conducted ethical penetration tests on web applications for several well-known companies and created my own malware, including a Trojan and a builder panel, strictly for ethical purposes.

I am passionate about security and ethical hacking, and I constantly seek to expand my knowledge and skills in this ever-evolving field.
